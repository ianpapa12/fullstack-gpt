       "AIMessage(content=\"For a vegetarian version of Chicken Tikka Masala, we can substitute the chicken with a plant-based alternative such as tofu or paneer. Here's how you can prepare these alternatives:\\n\\n1. **Tofu**: \\n   - Use extra-firm tofu and press it to remove excess water. You can do this by wrapping the tofu block in a clean kitchen towel and placing a heavy object on top for about 15-20 minutes.\\n   - Cut the tofu into bite-sized cubes and follow the same marination process as you would with chicken. Tofu absorbs flavors well, so marinating it for a longer time will enhance the taste.\\n   - Instead of baking, you can pan-fry the marinated tofu in a bit of oil until it gets a golden crust on the outside.\\n\\n2. **Paneer**:\\n   - Paneer is a type of Indian cheese that holds its shape well when cooked. You can find it in Indian grocery stores or make it at home by curdling hot milk with lemon juice or vinegar.\\n   - Cut the paneer into cubes and lightly fry them in a pan until they turn slightly golden. You can also marinate the paneer cubes before frying for added flavor.\\n   \\nBy using tofu or paneer as a substitute for chicken, you can still enjoy the rich and flavorful Chicken Tikka Masala with a vegetarian twist. Enjoy your cooking!\")"
